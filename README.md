minimum ram 1 GB or 512 RAM + 512 SWAP.<br>
Not tested in centos 6 but it should be fine.<br>
Maybe will be fine for another gcc version. Just change 4.9.3 with the version you want.<br>
Change numproc value with your number of processor to make compiling faster. Check processor number with "nproc" command.<br>
